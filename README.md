# DataQualityMacros
macros for alignment

1) plot a series of residual plots: makeQualityPlots.sh - usage:

   ./makeQualityPlots.sh PathToRootFile/inputRootFile.root GeometryType
   
   the gif files are moved to the directory run_GeometryFile and all of them are opened for inspection with gthumb once all     macros  have been run
